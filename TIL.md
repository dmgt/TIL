### R morsels

#### Quick tips
- `spelling::spell_check_setup()` to check for spelling errors or missing quotes (via [Carl Boettiger on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cboettig/status/1017257307263066112?s=19))
- `knitr::write_bib(c("knitr", "shiny"))` will generate the citation for knitr and shiny
- `glimpse()` or `View()`
- [skimr](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) "A frictionless, pipeable approach to dealing with summary statistics"


#### Tutorials

#### Markdown
 
 - [R Markdown: The definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
 - [Some Lesser Known Features of knitr](https://slides.yihui.name/2018-knitr-RaukR-Yihui-Xie.html#1), Yihui Xie, 2018
 - There is an RStudio add-in called "Infinitive Moon Reader" that [enables](https://slides.yihui.name/2018-knitr-RaukR-Yihui-Xie.html#11) live preview of documents without having to continually knit them 
 - In theory it's possible to use https://yihui.name/tinytex/ instead of MikTeX for future LaTeX installs on Windows, in practice I have yet to do so

### Databases
 - **SQL** stands for Structured Query Language
 - **SPARQL** stands for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language
   - ["RDF is a directed, labeled graph data format"](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)
   - SPARQL is canonically pronounced very similarly to `sparklyr`, but they are conceptually very different
