*A summary of resources for getting started with R*

## Getting started
1. The first step is to install both R and RStudio:
- https://www.r-project.org/
- https://www.rstudio.com/ 
   - Here is an [R Studio cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf) for reference

2. Next, you may want to watch some videos / do some web-based tutorials that introduce the main parts of the interface,
- Here are two that are free to start from Dataquest:
    - https://www.dataquest.io/course/intro-to-r/
    - https://www.dataquest.io/course/r-data-viz/

- Later sections cost $ but once you get started many of the best resources are free, so I don't think you neccesarily need to pay for a subscription beyond Dataquest's 4 free R courses: https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst-r/

3. Third, see this popular free online book is a reference and further information on the R `tidyverse` world for data analysis: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ (collegues and I learned from this book and I refer to it often)

UC Berkeley community note: There are also in-person workshops on campus organized by the [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) that are free and also introduce some of this material.

## Additional resources for reference:

Free and aimed at beginners - these are self-paced, written lessons that require setting up R and Rstudio yourself (they're not in browser like the dataquest ones above), but they are exactly focused on key skills for researchers
 
   1. [Software Carpentry online lesson on introduction to programming in R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
   2. [Software Carpentry online lesson on reproducible scientific analysis using RStudio and R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
   3. Setting up and troubleshooting R with git for version control: http://happygitwithr.com/ 
   4 For more on statistics in R, see the the older book "Simple R", and the newer `tidymodels` [tutorials](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/) 

For help, the [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/) blog aggregator has many helpful tutorials, and for questions I suggest searching on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) (though information can be outdated)

*What about DataCamp?*
You may encounter similar resources through the online learning platform DataCamp. As a former DataCamp user, I no longer recommend their products based on the company's poor treatment of their staff, instructors, and user community in the aftermath of an incident of sexual assualt by a member of their executive team. For more, see ["Don't take my DataCamp Course, there must be consequences for sexual assualt"](https://www.noamross.net/2019/04/12/datacamp-sexual-assault/), [this](https://dhavide.github.io/a-note-to-our-commuity-on-building-trust.html) account by a former employee, or [this](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) article from BuzzFeed news. 

[Here](https://github.com/Chris-Engelhardt/data_sci_guide) is a crowdsourced list of alternatives to DataCamp courses.
